## Summary

The R package riversCentralAsia includes a set of tools to facilitate and automate data preparation for hydrological modelling. It thus contributes to more reproducible modelling workflows and makes hydrological modelling more accessible to students and to interested professional modelers. 

The package has been developed within the frame of a master level course on applied hydrological modelling in Central Asia and is extensively used in the open-source book modelling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central Asia [@CAHAM:2022]. The workflows are further validated within the Horizon 2020 project HYDRO4U [@Hydro4u:2022].

While the package has been developed for the Central Asia region, most of the functions are generic and can be used for modelling projects anywhere in the world.

The most important functionalities of the package as well as the raw data that can be processed with the package are described in the the articles of the [project documentation site](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/){target="_blank"} but the examples in the course book [modelling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central Asia](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/){target="_blank"} demonstrate the full range of functions available and how touse them in a workflow.

## Statement of need

Data preparation comes before hydrological modelling and is actually one of the biggest work chunks in the modelling process. This package includes a number of helper functions that can be connected to efficient workflows that automatize the data preparation process for hydrological modelling as shown in the figure below. 

!["Overview over the modelling workflow supported by the riversCentralAsia package (Image source: Marti et al., 2022). This package supports the data processing components in R. Abbreviations are explained in the text. The workflow relies entirely on free, publicly available data and software."](./man/figures/fig_01_model_chain_bw.png){ width=80% }  

The data preparation step covered by the riversCentralAsia package the derivation of hydrological response units (HRU) using a basin outline and the [SRTM digital elevation model (DEM)](https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003){target="_blank"}. The derivation of the basin outline and processing of geospatial layers for import to RS MINERVE in QGIS is described in detail in @CAHAM:2022.  

Although the High Mountain region of Central Asia is generally perceived as a data scarce region, a number of gridded data products are available that form a fair basis for regional hydrological modelling at seasonal time scales. [CHELSA v2.1](https://chelsa-climate.org/){target="_blank"} is a weather data product at 1 km2 by 1km2 resolution. The *riversCentralAsia* package includes the function [*gen_HRU_Climate_CSV_RSMinerve*](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/gen_HRU_Climate_CSV_RSMinerve.html){target="_blank"} which extracts CHELSA precipitation or temperature on the hydrological response units and returns the data in an RS MINERVE readable format.  
[Glacier thinning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03436-z){target="_blank"} and [glacier ablation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23073-4){target="_blank"} are data sets from open-access literature which can used to calibrate the [GSM model objects](https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_hydrological_models.html#sec-model_gsm){target="_blank"} (a glacier runoff model) in RS MINERVE. Data on snow water equivalents is sourced from the [High Mountain Asia Snow Reanalysis (HMASR) Product](https://doi.org/10.5067/HNAUGJQXSCVU){target="_blank"} and can be used to calibrate the snow module of the [HBV model objects](https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_hydrological_models.html#sec-model_hbv) (a rainfall-runoff model) in RS MINERVE. The *riversCentralAsia* package site includes a [demonstration of how HMASR data can be used for model calibration](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/05-snow-calibration.html){target="_blank"}. The process is very similar for the calibration of glacier thinning and discharge.  
River discharge is taken from the hydrological year books of the HydroMeteorological Institutes in Central Asia. The package riversCentralAsia includes discharge time series from the Chirchiq river basin north-east of Tashkent (Uzbekistan) as well as several functions for loading discharge data, aggregating and visualization of discharge data and discharge statistics (discharge characterization) (see the [documentation on the discharge functions](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/01-discharge-processing-examples.html){target="_blank"}).  
And last but not least, [CMIP6 climate model results area are available from Copernicus](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip6?tab=form){target="_blank"}. The *riversCentralAsia* package can be used for [downscaling climate projections](https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/doQuantileMapping.html){target="_blank"} using CHELSA data and to produce RS MINERVE readable climate forcing. We use quantile mapping as statistical downscaling method [@gudmundsson_technical_2012; @qmap_package].    

Hydrological modelling is done using the free hydrologic-hydraulic modelling software
<a href="https://crealp.ch/rs-minerve/" target="_blank">RS Minerve</a> (not included in this package). Some alternative geoprocessing workflows in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/){target="_blank"} are described in @CAHAM:2022. 

The *riversCentralAsia* package functionality includes:

-   Efficient processing of present and future climate forcing,
    including hydro-meterological data from Central Asia (<a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/01-discharge-processing-examples.html"
    target="_blank">time series</a> and re-analysis data) and
    down-scaling of ERA5 re-analysis data (a more advanced topic which
    is described in the
    <a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/climate_data.html"
    target="_blank">course book</a>)

-   The <a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/02-preparation-of-climate-forcing.html"
    target="_blank">preparation of GIS layers for automated model
    generation</a> and chapter <a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/geospatial_data.html"
    target="_blank">Geospatial data</a> in the course book

-   <a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/04-glacier-functions.html"
    target="_blank">Volume area scaling of glaciers</a>

-   Post-processing of simulation results, e.g.Â <a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/05-snow-calibration.html"
    target="_blank">extraction and visualisation of snow water
    equivalent</a> or <a
    href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/computeAnnualFlowDurationCurve.html"
    target="_blank">computation of flow duration curves</a>

-   I/O interface with the hydrologic-hydraulic modelling software that allows reading and writing of input and output files of the hydraulic-hydrological modelling software <a href="https://crealp.ch/rs-minerve/" target="_blank">RS Minerve</a>.

While here, we focus on the description of the individual functions, the
strengths of the package comes to play mostly when the functions are
connected to automatize the data preparation process. These workflows
are extensively documented in the book
<a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/"
target="_blank">modelling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central
Asia</a>.

Currently, a relatively complete dataset of the Chirchik River Basin
with decadal and monthly data on discharge, precipitation and
temperature is included.


## Related packages
The hydraulic-hydrological modelling software RS MINERVE can be accessed through Common Language Runtime (CLR) directly from within R, thus the use of the RS MINERVE GUI can be avoided and multiple runs of large models can be speed up. The [github repository RSMinerveR](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/RSMinerveR){target="_blank"} includes examples of how to use CLR commands to use the Visual Basic interface with RS MINERVE documented in the [technical manual](https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_scripts.html){target="_blank}. This functionality is recommended for advanced users of RS MINERVE only. 

There are a number of existing R packages available that support data preparation and  hydrological modelling [@slater_using_2019]. However, apart from riversCentralAsia, there is no R package to facilitate hydrological modelling specifically with RS MINERVE which is a powerful, accessible tool for water resources management in mountainous regions.  

## Installation

The package requires R >= 4.1

The package has many dependencies which will be installed alongside
*riversCentralAsia*. To successfully install the package you need prior
installations of the following packages: rlang, magrittr, stringr and
purrr. Should the installation fail, test if you have the following
dependencies installed.

``` r
find.package(c("rlang", "magrittr", "stringr", "purrr"))
```

If they are not yet available on your system, please install them using
the following commands.

``` r
install.packages(c("rlang", "magrittr", "stringr", "purrr"))
```

All other dependencies are installed automatically. 

**Note** that **Mac** users may have to install the binary version of 
the dependency package exactextractr manually (not the more recent
source version). 

**Note** that **Windows** users require a working installation of
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/"
target="_blank">RTools</a> to install packages from github.

You can install the development version from
<a href="https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia/"
target="_blank">GitHub</a> with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia")
library(riversCentralAsia)
```

We recommend testing of the riversCentralAsia package before using it to
make sure all dependencies integrate with the riversCentralAsia package
as they should. The following step-by-step instructions explain how to
do this:

1.  Go to the [packages github
    repository](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia),
    click the green code button and select download zip. This will
    download a zip folder with the package code to your Download
    folder.  
2.  Extract the package files to a location of your preference. More
    detailed instructions for this step: right-click on the zip folder
    and select âextract allâin the pop-up window. Select a location to
    extract the files to and wait for the process to finish.  
3.  Navigate into the riversCentralAsia folder to in which the freshly
    downloaded package data is stored and open the riversCentralAsia R
    project file. This will open the project in your R GUI.  
4.  In the R console, type `devtools::test()` and hit enter. The tests
    will run for about a minute. If the test return
    `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 86 ]` at the end, all test were
    successful and the package will run without problems on your system.
    Should one of the tests fail, please make sure all the package
    dependencies are up to date. If the problem persists, please file an
    [issue](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia/issues)
    including the error message you get so we can look at the problem
    and hopefully solve it.  
5.  If you donât need the source codes any more, you can safely delete
    the zip file and the folder with the extracted riversCentralAsia
    files.

## Mentions
The package is used extensively in the course book modelling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central Asia [@CAHAM:2022]. The course book is published jointly with free lecture material and student case studies and can be used as basis for a master-level course on hydrological modelling [@egusphere-2022-966].    

The workflows presented in the course book, using the *riversCentralAsia* package, are further validated within the Horizon 2020 project HYDRO4U [@Hydro4u:2022] where future small hydro power potential is evaluated using hydrological modelling.

For advanced R & RS Minerve users, the vignettes in the repository *RSMinverveR* [@RSMinerveR:2022] is recommended which allows the interfacing between R and RS Minerve (with examples based on the Visual Basic Script examples by CREALP).

## Acknowledgement
The preparation of the course book and thus the preparation of the package was financially supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the German Kazakh University in Almaty and hydrosolutions.
