# riversCentralAsia

## Summary

The R package riversCentralAsia includes a set of tools to facilitate
and automate data preparation for hydrological modelling. It thus
contributes to more reproducible modeling workflows and makes
hydrological modeling more accessible to students and to interested
professional modelers.

The package has been developed within the frame of a master level course
on applied hydrological modelling in Central Asia and is extensively
used in the open-source book
<a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/"
target="_blank">Modeling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central
Asia</a> (Siegfried & Marti, 2022). The workflows are further validated
within the Horizon 2020 project
<a href="https://hydro4u.eu/" target="_blank">HYDRO4U</a>.

While the package has been developed for the Central Asia region, most
of the functions are generic and can be used for modelling projects
anywhere in the world.

The most important functionalities of the package as well as the raw
data that can be processed with the package are described in the the
articles of the
<a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/"
target="_blank">project documentation site</a> but the examples in the
book <a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/"
target="_blank">Modeling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central
Asia</a> demonstrate the full range of functions available and how to
use them in a workflow.

## Statement of need

Data preparation comes before hydrological modelling and is actually one
of the biggest work chunks in the modelling process. This package
includes a number of helper functions that can be connected to efficient
workflows that automatize the data preparation process for hydrological
modelling as shown in the figure below. This supports a more
reproducible modelling workflow and improves the scalability of
hydrological modelling.

Figure: Overview over the modelling workflow whos R-components are
supported by the riversCentralAsia package (Image source: Marti et al.,
2022). Abbreviations are explained in the text. The workflow relies
entirely on free, publicly available data and software.

The data preparation step covered by the *riversCentralAsia* package the
derivation of hydrological response units (HRU) using a basin outline
and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003"
target="_blank">SRTM digital elevation model (DEM)</a>. The <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/geospatial_data.html#sec-catchment-delineation"
target="_blank">derivation of the basin outline</a> and <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/geospatial_data.html#sec-preparation-of-rsminerve-input-files"
target="_blank">processing of geospatial layers for import to RS
MINERVE</a> in QGIS is described in detail in @CAHAM:2022.

Although the High Mountain region of Central Asia is generally perceived
as a data scarce region, a number of gridded data products are available
that form a fair basis for regional hydrological modelling at seasonal
time scales.
<a href="https://chelsa-climate.org/" target="_blank">CHELSA v2.1</a> is
a weather data product at 1 km2 grid resolution. The *riversCentralAsia*
package includes the function <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/gen_HRU_Climate_CSV_RSMinerve.html"
target="_blank"><em>gen_HRU_Climate_CSV_RSMinerve</em></a> which
extracts CHELSA precipitation or temperature on the hydrological
response units and returns the data in an RS MINERVE readable format.  
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03436-z"
target="_blank">Glacier thinning</a> and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23073-4"
target="_blank">glacier ablation</a> are data sets from open-access
literature which can be used to calibrate the <a
href="https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_hydrological_models.html#sec-model_gsm"
target="_blank">GSM model objects</a> (a glacier runoff model) in RS
MINERVE. Data on snow water equivalents is sourced from the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5067/HNAUGJQXSCVU" target="_blank">High
Mountain Asia Snow Reanalysis (HMASR) Product</a> and can be used to
calibrate the snow module of the [HBV model
objects](https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_hydrological_models.html#sec-model_hbv)
(a rainfall-runoff model) in RS MINERVE. The *riversCentralAsia* package
site includes a <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/05-snow-calibration.html"
target="_blank">demonstration of how HMASR data can be used for model
calibration</a>. The process is very similar for the calibration of
glacier thinning and discharge.  
River discharge is taken from the hydrological year books of the
HydroMeteorological Institutes in Central Asia. The package
*riversCentralAsia* includes discharge time series from the Chirchiq
river basin north-east of Tashkent (Uzbekistan) as well as several
functions for loading discharge data, aggregating and visualization of
discharge data and discharge statistics (discharge characterization)
(see the <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/01-discharge-processing-examples.html"
target="_blank">documentation on the discharge functions</a>).  
And last but not least, <a
href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip6?tab=form"
target="_blank">CMIP6 climate model results area are available from
Copernicus</a>. The *riversCentralAsia* package can be used for <a
href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/doQuantileMapping.html"
target="_blank">downscaling climate projections</a> using CHELSA data
and to produce RS MINERVE readable climate forcing. We use quantile
mapping as statistical downscaling method
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qmap/"
target="_blank">qmap</a> package by L. Gudmundsson).

Hydrological modelling is done using the free hydrologic-hydraulic
modelling software
<a href="https://crealp.ch/rs-minerve/" target="_blank">RS MINERVE</a>.
Some alternative geoprocessing workflows are described in
<a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a>.

The riversCentralAsia package functionality includes:

- Efficient processing of present and future climate forcing, including
  hydro-meterological data from Central Asia (<a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/01-discharge-processing-examples.html"
  target="_blank">time series</a> and re-analysis data) and down-scaling
  of ERA5 re-analysis data (a more advanced topic which is described in
  the
  <a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/climate_data.html"
  target="_blank">course book</a>)

- The <a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/02-preparation-of-climate-forcing.html"
  target="_blank">preparation of GIS layers for automated model
  generation</a> and chapter <a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/geospatial_data.html"
  target="_blank">Geospatial data</a> in the course book

- <a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/04-glacier-functions.html"
  target="_blank">Volume area scaling of glaciers</a>

- Post-processing of simulation results, e.g.Â <a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/articles/05-snow-calibration.html"
  target="_blank">extraction and visualisation of snow water
  equivalent</a> or <a
  href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/riversCentralAsia/reference/computeAnnualFlowDurationCurve.html"
  target="_blank">computation of flow duration curves</a>

- I/O interface with the hydrologic-hydraulic modelling software that
  allows reading and writing of input and output files of the
  hydraulic-hydrological modelling software
  <a href="https://crealp.ch/rs-minerve/" target="_blank">RS
  MINERVE</a>.

While here, we focus on the description of the individual functions, the
strengths of the package comes to play mostly when the functions are
connected to automatize the data preparation process. These workflows
are extensively documented in the book
<a href="https://hydrosolutions.github.io/caham_book/"
target="_blank">Modeling of Hydrological Systems in Semi-Arid Central
Asia</a>.

Currently, a relatively complete dataset of the Chirchik River Basin
with decadal and monthly data on discharge, precipitation and
temperature is included.

## Related packages

The hydraulic-hydrological modelling software RS MINERVE can be accessed
through Common Language Runtime (CLR) directly from within R, thus the
use of the RS MINERVE GUI can be avoided and multiple runs of large
models can be speed up. The
<a href="https://github.com/hydrosolutions/RSMinerveR"
target="_blank">github repository RSMinerveR</a> includes examples of
how to use CLR commands to use the Visual Basic interface with RS
MINERVE documented in the
<a href="https://crealp.github.io/rsminerve-releases/tech_scripts.html"
target="&quot;_blank">technical manual</a>. This functionality is
recommended for advanced users of RS MINERVE only.

## Installation

The package requires R version \>= 4.1

The package has many dependencies which will be installed alongside
riversCentralAsia. To successfully install the package you need prior
installations of the following packages: rlang, magrittr, stringr and
purrr. Should the installation fail, test if you have the following
dependencies installed.

``` r
find.package(c("rlang", "magrittr", "stringr", "purrr"))
```

If they are not yet available on your system, please install them using
the following commands.

``` r
install.packages(c("rlang", "magrittr", "stringr", "purrr"))
```

All other dependencies are installed automatically.

**Note** that **Mac** users may have to install the binary version of
the dependency package exactextractr manually (not the more recent
source version).

**Note** that **Windows** users require a working installation of
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/"
target="_blank">RTools</a> to install packages from github.

You can install the development version from
<a href="https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia/"
target="_blank">GitHub</a> with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia")
library(riversCentralAsia)
```

We recommend testing of the riversCentralAsia package before using it to
make sure all dependencies integrate with the riversCentralAsia package
as they should. The following step-by-step instructions explain how to
do this:

1.  Go to the [packages github
    repository](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia),
    click the green code button and select download zip. This will
    download a zip folder with the package code to your Download
    folder.  
2.  Extract the package files to a location of your preference. More
    detailed instructions for this step: right-click on the zip folder
    and select âextract allâin the pop-up window. Select a location to
    extract the files to and wait for the process to finish.  
3.  Navigate into the riversCentralAsia folder to in which the freshly
    downloaded package data is stored and open the riversCentralAsia R
    project file. This will open the project in your R GUI.  
4.  In the R console, type `devtools::test()` and hit enter. The tests
    will run for about a minute. If the test return
    `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 86 ]` at the end, all test were
    successful and the package will run without problems on your system.
    Should one of the tests fail, please make sure all the package
    dependencies are up to date. If the problem persists, please file an
    [issue](https://github.com/hydrosolutions/riversCentralAsia/issues)
    including the error message you get so we can look at the problem
    and hopefully solve it.  
5.  If you donât need the source codes any more, you can safely delete
    the zip file and the folder with the extracted riversCentralAsia
    files.
