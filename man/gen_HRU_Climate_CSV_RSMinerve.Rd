\title{Extract hydrological response unit HRU specific climate time series from
nc-files.}
\usage{
gen_HRU_Climate_CSV_RSMinerve(
  climate_files,
  catchmentName,
  temp_or_precip,
  elBands_shp,
  startY,
  endY,
  obs_frequency,
  climate_data_type,
  crs_in_use,
  output_file_dir = 0,
  gcm_model = 0,
  gcm_scenario = 0,
  tz = "UTC"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{climate_files}{List of either temperature or precipitation climate .nc
files to process (do not mix!). Make sure the file list time interval is
consistent with startY and endY.}

\item{catchmentName}{Name of catchment for which data should be extracted}

\item{temp_or_precip}{Either 'Temperature' or 'Precipitation'}

\item{elBands_shp}{Shapefile with hydrological response units. The column
containing the names of the hydrological response units must be \code{name}
and the column containing the average elevation of the elevation band must
be \code{Z}. Please make sure that the shape file is in UTM coordinates.}

\item{startY}{Starting year for which data should be made available (assuming
data 'is' available from the start of that year)}

\item{endY}{Ending year from which data should be extracted (assuming data
'is' actually available until the end of that year)}

\item{obs_frequency}{Climate observation frequency ('hour', 'day', 'month')}

\item{climate_data_type}{String of denoting observation type. Either
'hist_obs' (historical observations, i.e. CHELSA V21 high resolution
climate data), 'hist_sim' (GCM model output data over the historical
period) and 'fut_sim' (fture GCM simulations)}

\item{crs_in_use}{Proj code for crs in use. For example
'+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84' for epsg 4326}

\item{output_file_dir}{Path to output file dir (if empty, file will not be
written)}

\item{tz}{Time zone information. Default "UTC" which can be overridden.}
}
\value{
Dataframe tibble with temperature in deg. C. or precipitation in mm/h
}
\description{
Function extracts precipitation (tp) or temperature (tas_) data from climate
raster bricks (observed history obs_hist, GCM-simulated history hist_sim and
GCM-simulated future (fut_sim) and prepares a dataframe for later import in
RSMinerve (use readr::write_csv(.,col_names=FALSE)). tp and tas_ have to be
exported, the function has to be called twice and the resulting tibble
columns added.
}
\note{
This function currently can only read input files with full years of
  data, that is, with data from January to December of a given year.
